# eggy

Simple terminal based egg timer

## Why

For some reason known only to God modern operating systems never include an egg timer.  I can only speculate that powerful men have a stake in mechanical egg timers.

## Installation

1. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pyfiglet.

```bash
pip install pyfiglet
```

2. Make the eggy Python script executable

```bash
chmod u+x eggy
```

## Usage

The following starts a count down timer for 15 minutes and 45 seconds.

```bash
eggy 15:45
```

## Output

```
 _ ____   _  _  ____  
/ | ___|_| || || ___| 
| |___ (_) || ||___ \ 
| |___) ||__   _|__) |
|_|____(_)  |_||____/ 
                      
```
